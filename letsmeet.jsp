<h2>These are the very objectives that the composer of Panchatantra, Pandit Vishnu Sharma, wanted to accomplish in order to provide maximum knowledge to three young princes through stories and examples. In fact, not just the princes, this most unique book has enlightened millions of readers and listeners for centuries. 
 </h2>
<h3>In the introductory narrative, the composer boldly declares:</h3>
<i>"Whoever learns the work by heart,
Or through the story-teller's art
Becomes acquainted,
His life by sad defeat - although
The king of heaven be his foe -
Is never tainted."</i>
